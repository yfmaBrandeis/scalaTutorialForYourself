#   Scala Tutorial for yourself
## Basic Syntax and introduction
Start your Scala in your command line tool(For windows) or terminal(Mac/Linux)

```scala
scala> println("Hello World!")
```
The result will be:
```Hello World!```
Also there is an another way to prompt Scala code.
First open your editor or IDE such as Intellij Idea and creat a **HelloWorld.scala** file and types in

```scala
Object HelloWorld{
    def main(args:Array[String]}{
        println("Hello,World!")//scala do not care if there is a ; line
    }
}
```
Open your terminal and prompt:

```Bash
>scalac HelloWorld.scala
>scala HelloWorld
>Hello,World!
```
In this tutorial, I suppose that you have already known how to compile java programs and run java classes. 
As you can see from the **HelloWorld.scala** file:
The **def main(args:Array[String])** is the way that scala create it functions which is very similar to python language.(I have used python for a rather long time. So the first time I saw the definition, I was amazed by this declaration, and it is also similar to Java.)
### How to name your Scala variables
Every language should have their variables and the rule to name those identifiers. Scala provide a standard identification rule as Java which means you can use either a letter or underscore to start your identifiers.
Several examples are provided:
```year, _length, mineCraft```
### Operator Identifiers
An operator identifier consists of one or more operator characters.Like
```+ ++ ::: <?> :>```
### Some scala keywords
| Keyword | keyword | Keyword |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abstract | Case | catch |
| False | Do | class |

Still there are many keywords in Scala.
### Declaring a variable
It is quiet common to declare several variables. In Scala, the interesting thing is that you may have several ways to define a variable or multi variables.

```Scala
var myVar : String = "Foo"//var means this myVar can be changed
val myVal : String = "Bar"//val means this myVal cannot be changed
```
Also it is valid if you do not assign a value to the variable.

```Scala
var myVar :Int;
val myVal :String;
```
Also it is valid to write your code so:

```Scala
var myVar = 40
val myVal = "Hello SCALA!"
val {myVar,myVal} = Pair(40,"Hello SCALA!")
```
### Data Access
The general case is that Scala also provide **private**,**public** and **protected** access modifiers which is just as Java, C++ as an object-oriented language. Some examples for Java programmers:

```Scala
class Outer{
    class Inner{
        private def In() {println("I am in the loop!")}
        class InnerMost {
            In() //output: I am in the loop.
        }
    }
    (new Inner).In() //Because it is private you cannot call this function, this line will give you an error.
}
```

```Scala
class Super{
    //protected means public to subclass and private to unrelated class
    protected def s() {"I am in a super class."}
}

class Sub extends Super {
    s()//works
}

class other {
    (new Super).s()//won't work
}
```
when you do not give an exact **private** or **protected** before your declaration, the default one will be **public**.
However the interesting thing is that Scala do provide a system for programmers to define different access to classes.
A modifier of the form **private[X]** or **protected[X]** means that access is private or protected "up to" class, package or object type X.

```Scala
package physics{
    package condensedPhysics{
        class SolidStatePhysics{
            private[physics] var commonTheorems;
            private[condensedPhysics] var scientists = null;
            private[this] var problems = null;
            
            def help( another : SolidStatePhysics) {
                println(another.commonTheorems)
                println(another.problems) // ERROR, the problems can only be accessed by the this reference
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Scala operations
Normal Syntax:

```Scala
Object Test{
    def main(Args : Array[]
var a = 50
var b = 30
println("a + b = "+(a+b))
println("a - b = "+(a-b))
println("a / b = "+(a/b))
println("a * b = "+(a*b))
println("a % b = "+(a%b))
```
The result is as follows:

```
> scalac Test.scala
> scala Test
> 80
> 20
> 1
> 1500
> 20
```

Other operators like `== != > < >= <=` are just as same as common language syntax.

Bitwise operators are as follows:

| Operator | Description(bitwise) |
| --- | --- |
| & | Binary ANDÂ  |
| ! | Binary OR |
| ^ | Binary XOR |
| ~ | Binary Complement |
| << | Binary Left Shift |
| >> | Binary Right Shift |

Other operators are just the same like `+= -= *= /=`

### Control flow
The **if else** style are just the same as Java.
Let's just see some examples

```Scala
Object Test{
    def main(Args:Array[String]){
        var x = 20;
        
        if (x>25){
            println("x is bigger than 25")
        }else println("x is smaller than 25")
    }
}
```
It is worth to note that the **else if** statement is also available. 
### Loop
There are three kinds of loop in Scala : **while loop**,**do while loop** and **for loop**.
#### While loop
```Scala
while (condition){
    statement(s)
}
```
#### Do while loop
```Scala
do{
    statement(s)
}while (condition)
```
#### For loop
This is kind of a interesting style. Let's just focus on the examples.

```Scala
for ( var x <- Range ){
    statement(s)
}
```
Range here could be a range of numbers such as **i to j** or **i until j**. The left arrow **<-** is a generator because it is generating values from the range.

```Scala
Object Test{
    def main(Args:Array[String]{
        var l = 0;
        
        for ( l <- 1 to 3 ){
            println("l value : "+ l )
        }
    }
} 
```
The results will be seen as:

```
>1
>2
>3
```
And if you use **i until j**:

```Scala
Object Test{
    def main(Args:Array[String]{
        var l = 0;
        
        for ( l <- 1 until 3 ){
            println("l value : "+ l )
        }
    }
} 
```

The results will be as:


```
>1
>2
```

Also we can use multiple ranges such as:

```Scala
Object Test {
    def main(Args : Array[String]){
        var a = 0 ;
        var b = 0;
        for ( a <- 1 to 3
             b <- 1 to 3){
             println("a + b = " + (a + b))
        }
    }
}
```
For loop is also valid in Collections:

```Scala
for (var x<- List){
    statement;
}
```
The List here is a collection of objects with same type.
Scala also provide filters in the for loop:

```Scala
for (var x<-List,
    if condition1; if condition2;....){//may have more conditions
    statement
}
```
**For loop with yield:** Scala provide a return syntax for the for loop with keyword **yield** through which you can store the list of return values.

```Scala
var retVar = for (x<-List,
                    if condition1; if condition2;....}yield x
```
Scala does not support break and continue statement like JAVA, however, it provides another mechanism of break statement.

```Scala
import scala.util.control._

val loop = new Breaks;//The scala.util.control package provides a special kind of object which is Breaks

loop.breakable{//make loop always breakable
    for (...){
        statement
        ...
        loop.break//break loop
    }
}
```

Let's see an example:

```Scala
import scala.util.control._

object Test(Args:Array[String]){
    var i = 0;
    val list = List{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
    
    var loop = new Breaks
    loop.breakable{
        for (i <- list){
            println(i)
            if (i==4){
                loop.break
            }
        }
    }
}           
```
The result will be

```
>scalac Test.scala
>scala Test
>1
>2
>3
>4
```

For nested loops, we have to create several breakable loops.
### Scala functions
Function definiton format:

```Scala
def functionName ([list of parameters]) : [return type]//method create this should be abstract
def functionName2 ([list of parameters]) : [return type] = {
    function body
    return expression
}
```

let's just create a adding method.

```Scala
def addTwoInt (a: Int, b: Int) : Int = {
    return a+b
}
```
The **void** return type is **Unit**.

```Scala
def printMe() : Unit = {
    println("Hi, I am Scala!")
}
```
Calling functions in Scala

```Scala
functionName([list of parameters])
[Instance].methodName([list of parameters])
```
Scala functions are the core part of Scala language, asides from the normal syntax above. Scala functions can be called through various ways.
#### Functions call by name
The normal functions calls parameters by value, which means that the input parameters' values are already fixed when the function is called. However, there is another way to call parameters. What if we can call an expression with no definite values into the function. The expression's value is only invoked when the function calls it.
A call-by-name mechanism passes a code block to the calling functions and each time it calls the code block passing through a parameter, the block will be evaluated and executed.

```Scala
object Test{
    def main(Args : Array[String]) {
            delay(time())
    }
    def time(){
        println("Getting time in nanoseconds.")
        System.nanoTime
    }
    def delayed(t :=> long){// => means call by name
        println("In delayed medthod")
        println("param t: "+t)
        t
    }
}
``` 
The result is:

```Scala
In delayed method
Getting time in nanoseconds
param t: //(long integer)
Getting time in nanoseconds
param t: x
Getting time in nanoseconds

```
Function with variable arguments
Scala provide a similar system as Python to allow parameters passing into the function to be repeated.

```Scala
object Test{
    def main(args:Array[String]){
        printStrings("Hello","Scala","Python")
    }
    
    def printStrings(Args:String*) = {//Args:String* tells that this is a list of parameters
    var i : Int = 0
    for (arg <- Args){
        prinln("Args["+i+"]"+arg)
        i++
    }
}   
```
Scala also provide default parameters values.

```Scala
def addTwo(x:Double = 5.0,y:Double = 3.0) = {
    var Sum:Double = 0
    Sum = a+b
    
    return sum
}
```
Scala is so-called functional programming language because it can pass function as a parameter into a function.
There are also other ways to declare the functions:

```Scala
var mul = (x:Int,y:Int) => x*y
var useDir = () => {System.getProperty("user.dir")}
```
### Scala Closures
A closure is a function that return value depends on the value of one or more variables outside the function which is kind of easy.
### Scala Strings
How to create stringsï¼

```Scala
val greeting = "Hello World!"
val greeting2 : String = "Hello World!"
```
String type is very similar to the String Class in Java, so the method is a lot like the Java String.(Other methods canb
Concatenating the string can use either `+ or String.concat(String)`
#### Format String
The `printf` method has been a default method in Scala, which makes it quiet a convenient way to print format strings.
### Scala Arrays
Scala also provides the general array data structure.

```Scala
var z:Array[String] = new Array[String](3)
var z2 = new Array[String](3)
z(0) = "zara";z(1) = "nuha";z(2) = "Ayan"
var z3 = {"zara","nuha","Ayan"}
``` 
**Multidimensional Array**

```Scala
var matrix=new Array[Int](3,3)//3*3 matrix
```
The interesting thing of array in Scala is that arrays can concatenate each other using the following command:

```Scala
import Array._ //important
...
List3 = concat(List1,List2)
...
```

The keyword **range** in Array package also has the same syntax as python **range**.
