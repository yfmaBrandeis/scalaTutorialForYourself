#   Scala Tutorial for yourself
## Basic Syntax and introduction
Start your Scala in your command line tool(For windows) or terminal(Mac/Linux)

```scala
scala> println("Hello World!")
```
The result will be:
```Hello World!```
Also there is an another way to prompt Scala code.
First open your editor or IDE such as Intellij Idea and creat a **HelloWorld.scala** file and types in

```scala
Object HelloWorld{
    def main(args:Array[String]}{
        println("Hello,World!")//scala do not care if there is a ; line
    }
}
```
Open your terminal and prompt:

```Bash
>scalac HelloWorld.scala
>scala HelloWorld
>Hello,World!
```
In this tutorial, I suppose that you have already known how to compile java programs and run java classes. 
As you can see from the **HelloWorld.scala** file:
The **def main(args:Array[String])** is the way that scala create it functions which is very similar to python language.(I have used python for a rather long time. So the first time I saw the definition, I was amazed by this declaration, and it is also similar to Java.)
### How to name your Scala variables
Every language should have their variables and the rule to name those identifiers. Scala provide a standard identification rule as Java which means you can use either a letter or underscore to start your identifiers.
Several examples are provided:
```year, _length, mineCraft```
### Operator Identifiers
An operator identifier consists of one or more operator characters.Like
```+ ++ ::: <?> :>```
### Some scala keywords
| Keyword | keyword | Keyword |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abstract | Case | catch |
| False | Do | class |

Still there are many keywords in Scala.
### Declaring a variable
It is quiet common to declare several variables. In Scala, the interesting thing is that you may have several ways to define a variable or multi variables.

```Scala
var myVar : String = "Foo"//var means this myVar can be changed
val myVal : String = "Bar"//val means this myVal cannot be changed
```
Also it is valid if you do not assign a value to the variable.

```Scala
var myVar :Int;
val myVal :String;
```
Also it is valid to write your code so:

```Scala
var myVar = 40
val myVal = "Hello SCALA!"
val {myVar,myVal} = Pair(40,"Hello SCALA!")
```
### Data Access
The general case is that Scala also provide **private**,**public** and **protected** access modifiers which is just as Java, C++ as an object-oriented language. Some examples for Java programmers:

```Scala
class Outer{
    class Inner{
        private def In() {println("I am in the loop!")}
        class InnerMost {
            In() //output: I am in the loop.
        }
    }
    (new Inner).In() //Because it is private you cannot call this function, this line will give you an error.
}
```

```Scala
class Super{
    //protected means public to subclass and private to unrelated class
    protected def s() {"I am in a super class."}
}

class Sub extends Super {
    s()//works
}

class other {
    (new Super).s()//won't work
}
```
when you do not give an exact **private** or **protected** before your declaration, the default one will be **public**.
However the interesting thing is that Scala do provide a system for programmers to define different access to classes.
A modifier of the form **private[X]** or **protected[X]** means that access is private or protected "up to" class, package or object type X.

```Scala
package physics{
    package condensedPhysics{
        class SolidStatePhysics{
            private[physics] var commonTheorems;
            private[condensedPhysics] var scientists = null;
            private[this] var problems = null;
            
            def help( another : SolidStatePhysics) {
                println(another.commonTheorems)
                println(another.problems) // ERROR, the problems can only be accessed by the this reference
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Scala operations
Normal Syntax:

```Scala
Object Test{
    def main(Args : Array[]
var a = 50
var b = 30
println("a + b = "+(a+b))
println("a - b = "+(a-b))
println("a / b = "+(a/b))
println("a * b = "+(a*b))
println("a % b = "+(a%b))
```
The result is as follows:

```
> scalac Test.scala
> scala Test
> 80
> 20
> 1
> 1500
> 20
```

Other operators like `== != > < >= <=` are just as same as common language syntax.

Bitwise operators are as follows:

| Operator | Description(bitwise) |
| --- | --- |
| & | Binary ANDÂ  |
| ! | Binary OR |
| ^ | Binary XOR |
| ~ | Binary Complement |
| << | Binary Left Shift |
| >> | Binary Right Shift |

Other operators are just the same like `+= -= *= /=`

### Control flow
The **if else** style are just the same as Java.
Let's just see some examples

```Scala
Object Test{
    def main(Args:Array[String]){
        var x = 20;
        
        if (x>25){
            println("x is bigger than 25")
        }else println("x is smaller than 25")
    }
}
```
It is worth to note that the **else if** statement is also available. 
### Loop
There are three kinds of loop in Scala : **while loop**,**do while loop** and **for loop**.
#### While loop
```Scala
while (condition){
    statement(s)
}
```
#### Do while loop
```Scala
do{
    statement(s)
}while (condition)
```
#### For loop
This is kind of a interesting style. Let's just focus on the examples.

```Scala
for ( var x <- Range ){
    statement(s)
}
```
Range here could be a range of numbers such as **i to j** or **i until j**. The left arrow **<-** is a generator because it is generating values from the range.

```Scala
Object Test{
    def main(Args:Array[String]{
        var l = 0;
        
        for ( l <- 1 to 3 ){
            println("l value : "+ l )
        }
    }
} 
```
The results will be seen as:

```
>1
>2
>3
```
And if you use **i until j**:

```Scala
Object Test{
    def main(Args:Array[String]{
        var l = 0;
        
        for ( l <- 1 until 3 ){
            println("l value : "+ l )
        }
    }
} 
```

The results will be as:


```
>1
>2
```

Also we can use multiple ranges such as:

```Scala
Object Test {
    def main(Args : Array[String]){
        var a = 0 ;
        var b = 0;
        for ( a <- 1 to 3
             b <- 1 to 3){
             println("a + b = " + (a + b))
        }
    }
}
```
Stay TUNED.
